# Week 5 Homework

## issues
I was very excited to start this project to learn how to create both interactive and independent animation, but I had a difficult time executing the assignment. I think two of my biggest problems are fundamental, and I need to work on them. One of these problems is that I have trouble knowing which coordinates to place my shapes at, as it's hard for me to tell in my head, or even graphing it out on paper, where everything is going to end up placement wise. This leads me to a rather painful process of trial and error. The other issue that I was having this week was with the push and pops. I didn't fully understand what they were used for in the previous weeks, and that led me to have a lot of problems creating shapes that were animated independently of one another. However, I did fix this problem and I have a far better understanding of what push and pops are used for now.

## Overall
Overall, I enjoyed playing around with this assignment and getting to know the program better, the p5 website was very helpful, as it was last week. I feel as though I am missing a few key components of coding in general that are making things perhaps harder than they need to be, but I am hoping to come in next week to office hours to get some clarification.
