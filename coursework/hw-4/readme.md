# Week 4 Homework
I am turning this homework in a few days late due to some personal issues that prevented me from getting it done on time.

## issues
I found this assignment to be far more difficult than anything we have been assigned before, partially because of the freedom of creativity that we were given and partially because I had some technical issues. In the beginning, I copied the empty file and re-labeled it "homework 4" and started coding, but soon realized that my index.html would not allow me to preview my work through a web browser as it had done so in homework 3. After going over my code several times to check that it was correct, I went to the issues forum and found there was a girl that was having similar problems to me. Although there didn't seem to be any concrete answers, she said that she eventually had to delete her folder and make a new one. I then did the same and was able to view my code in the web browser. After this everything ran fairly smoothly until I tried to make my hw-4 work go live, I am still getting the 404 error, but will keep trying, it worked for me last week and I'm not quite sure why it isn't working now.

## Overall
Overall, I enjoyed playing around with this assignment and getting to know the program better, the p5 website was very helpful. However, I think I will need to come into office hours this week to get a few things clarified that I am still confused about.
