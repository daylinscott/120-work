["Hello,World!"}(https://daylinscott.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

# Homework 3 experience
Overall, I found this to be a fairly straightforward assignment. Initially, I was overwhelmed when I went through all of the things we had to learn about, but after watching the videos and reading through all of the resources provided one at a time, the assignment became much clearer. I had a lot of fun expiramenting with the color and placement of font on my live website, and I'm excited to be able to use coding in a more creative fashion in the coming weeks.

## Homework 3 issues
I briefly had a problem with trying to get the "Hello, World!" to appear in the browser, but quickly realized it was an easy fix and i just needed to add the final "}". Other than that, I didnt really have any problems this week.
